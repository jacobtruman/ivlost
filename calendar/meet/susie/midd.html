Susie is earnest, serious and smart. . . . I suspect that Calvin has a mild crush on her
that he expresses by trying to annoy her, but Susie is a bit unnerved and put off by
Calvin's weirdness. This encourages Calvin to be even weirder, so it's a good dynamic.
Neither of them quite understands what's going on, which is probably true of most
relationships.
