I've never given Calvin's parents names, because as far as the strip is concerned, they
are important only as Calvin's mom and dad. Calvin's dad has been rumored to be a
self-portrait. All my characters are half me, so it's true in some ways, but Calvin's dad
is also partly a satire of my own father. Any strip about how suffering "builds character"
is usually a verbatim transcript of my dad's explanations for why we were all freezing,
exhausted, hungry and lost on camping trips. These things are a lot funnier after 25 years
have passed.

Calvin's mom is the daily disciplinarian, a job that taxes her sanity, so I think we get
to see her at her best. I regret that the strip mostly shows her impatient side, but I try
to hint at other aspects of her personality and her interests by what she's doing when
Calvin barges in.

. . . As secondary characters, I've tried to keep Calvin's parents realistic, with a
reasonable sense of humor about having a kid like Calvin. I think they do a better job
