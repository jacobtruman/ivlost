Named after a seventeenth-century philosopher with a dim view of human nature, Hobbes has
the patient dignity and common sense of most animals I've met. Hobbes was very much
inspired by one of our cats, a gray tabby named Sprite. Sprite not only provided the long
body and facial characteristics for Hobbes, she also was the model for his personality.
She was good-natured, intelligent, friendly, and enthusiastic in a sneaking-up-and-pouncing
sort of way. Sprite suggested the idea of Hobbes greeting Calvin at the door in midair at
high velocity.

The so-called "gimmick" of my strip -- the two versions of Hobbes -- is sometimes
misunderstood. I don't think of Hobbes as a doll that miraculously comes to life when
Calvin's around. Neither do I think of Hobbes as the product of Calvin's imagination. . . .
Calvin sees Hobbes one way, and everyone else sees Hobbes another way. I show two versions
of reality, and each makes complete sense to the participant who sees it. I think that's
how life works. None of us sees the world exactly the same way, and I just draw that
literally in the strip.
