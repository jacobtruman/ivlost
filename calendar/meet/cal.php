Calvin is named for a sixteenth-century theologian who believed in predestination.
Most people assume that Calvin is based on a son of mine, or based on detailed memories
of my own childhood. In fact, I don't have children, and I was a fairly quiet, obedient
kid -- almost Calvin's opposite. One of the reasons that Calvin's character is fun to
write is that I often don't agree with him. . . .

Many of Calvin's struggles are metaphors for my own. I suspect that most of us get old
without growing up, and that inside every adult (sometimes not very far inside) is a
bratty kid who wants everything his own way. I use Calvin as an outlet for my immaturity,
as a way to keep myself curious about the natural world, as a way to ridicule my own
obsessions, and as a way to comment on human nature. I wouldn't want Calvin in my house,
but on paper, he helps me sort through my life and understand it.
