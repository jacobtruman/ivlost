Probably the only person Calvin fears is his baby-sitter. I put her in a Sunday strip
early on, never thinking of her as a regular character, but her intimidation of Calvin
surprised me, so she's made a few appearances since. Rosalyn even seems to daunt Calvin's
parents, using their desperation to get out of the house to demand advances and raises.
Rosalyn's relationship with Calvin is pretty one-dimensional, so baby-sitter stories get
harder and harder to write, but for a later addition to the strip, she's worked pretty well.
