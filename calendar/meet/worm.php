As a few readers guessed, Miss Wormwood is named after the apprentice devil in C.S.
Lewis' "The Screwtape Letters." I have a lot of sympathy for Miss Wormwood. We see hints
that she's waiting to retire, that she smokes too much, and that she takes a lot of
medication. I think she seriously believes in the value of education, so needless to say,
she's an unhappy person.
