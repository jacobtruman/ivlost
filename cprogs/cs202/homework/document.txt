// CLASS PROVIDED: point (an ADT for a point on a three-dimensional plane)
//
// CONSTRUCTOR for the point class:
//   point(double initial_x = 0.0, double initial_y = 0.0, duble initial_z = 0.0)
//     Postcondition: The point has been set to (initial_x, initial_y, initial_z).
//
// MODIFICATION MEMBER FUNCTIONS for the point class:
//   void shift_x(double x_amount)
//     Postcondition: The point has been moved by x_amount along the x axis
//
//   void shift_y(double y_amount)
//     Postcondition: The point has been moved by y_amount along the y axis.
//
//   void shift_z(double z_amount)
//     Postcondition: The point has been moved by z_amount along the z axis.
//
//   void rotate_x(double a_amount);
//     Postcondition: The other 2 points have been rotated clockwise on the x axis "a_amount" degrees.
//
//   void rotate_y(double a_amount);
//     Postcondition: The other 2 points have been rotated clockwise on the y axis "a_amount" degrees.
//
//   void rotate_z(double a_amount);
//     Postcondition: The other 2 points have been rotated clockwise on the z axis "a_amount" degrees.
//
// CONSTANT MEMBER FUNCTIONS for the point class:
//   double get_x( ) const
//     Postcondition: The value returned is the x coordinate of the point.
//
//   double get_y( ) const
//     Postcondition: The value returned is the y coordinate of the point.
//
//   double get_z( ) const
//     Postcondition: The value returned is the z coordinate of the point.

// FILE: main.cxx
// 
// Set x to "2.5", y to "0" and z to "2.0".
// Shift all points "1.0" units.
// Rotate points 90 degrees on the x axis.
// Rotate points 180 degrees on the y axis.
// Rotate points 45 degrees along the z axis.
// Print the three resulting points.
