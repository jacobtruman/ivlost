<font style='FONT-SIZE:12pt;'><b><u>Uneducated/Ignorance</u></b></font>
What is it like to not know how to do your job, and yet not get fired.  Day after day, you fail to catch on to the simple little things you are supposed to already know before being hired, you constantly aggrivate customers and coworkers alike; It must make for a miserable work experience, you would dread going to work everyday.  I have a coworker like this.  He should be let go, but probably won\'t be because management here does not seem to care.  Oh well, at least it makes me feel smarter :)

<font style='FONT-SIZE:12pt;'><b><u>Work Sux</u></b></font>
I got to work tonight - almost noone was there.  The guy that I share a desk with (Vince) was still logged, but nowhere to be found.  Jim was not here.  After 20 min, the 2nd shift supervisor showed up with 2 other guys (from a smoke break) and said that Jim had called in sick.  Then Vince was working on something til 1:30AM, so I was on another computer and could not access all the programs that I needed to do my job.  Not the best start to a day.  It is really busy at work, I have 8 sections of calulus to catch up on, a computer science program to write and finals to study for.  Some days you just want to say "I'm done with this, whats next?"  Hope the rest of the day gets better.

<font style='FONT-SIZE:12pt;'><b><u>42 hour day</u></b></font>
Well, my day ended up being 42 hours - thats my own personal record - 31 hours was my previous record.  I fell asleep on the freeway in Salt Lake that time.  I wan't as tired as I thought I might be.

<font style='FONT-SIZE:12pt;'><b><u>34 hours and going</u></b></font>
It has been a pretty long day.  I got up for work at 10:30 PM on Wed - it is now about 8:30 AM on Fri.  I have not gotten any sleep in that time period.  I am actually not that tired right now.  Of course, now that I have said that i am gonna get really tired all of a sudden.  Being tired (or sick) at work sux - but thats life.  Maybe this will be a good weekend....

<font style='FONT-SIZE:12pt;'><b><u>New Excitement</u></b></font>
There has been an outpouring of excitement on ivlost!  We now have 2 users (other than myself).  Welcome loser - you fit in perfectly here.  Still, noone has posted anything on the message board.  If only I had the time to finish my blog, user account system, events calendar... oh yeah, school work, side work (1, possibly 2, web sites to design), resume sprucing (always like to update it as I go), my family (who never gets to see me), CCNA studying... yeah I think thats about it.  I was approached by a coworker (at work, of all places) about doing a site for his table tennis club.  That may give me the opportunity to finish my events calendar.  I have the code in my head, I just have yet to put implement it.  Some day....

<font style='FONT-SIZE:12pt;'><b><u>New User</u></b></font>
Well, I now have a new user on my site.  Nobody comes here, so it doesn't really matter.  Harvey, now you need to figure out how to post to the message board - go to Blog and you can post a message.  Of course I haven't completely finished it so it will be posted right away.  Eventually I will have to evaluate anything before it shows up. Well, have fun.

<font style='FONT-SIZE:12pt;'><b><u>Web Hosting</u></b></font>
I am doing some research on web hosting companies.  So far I have evaluated <a href='http://sorayume.com/' target='_blank'>sorayume.com</a> and <a href='http://thewebco.com/' target='_blank'>thewebco.com</a>.  I was most impressed with sorayume.com - they have the most features for the best deal.

<font style='FONT-SIZE:12pt;'><b><u>What is ivlost?</u></b></font>
ivlost is my website. It is dedicated to my stuff - pictures of my family and I, a Calvin and Hobbes calendar, and my little message board that you are looking at now.  ivlost is not flashy, but very functional.  I am pretty conservative with my site - clean and precise.  I am contstantly making updates and adding new features. Right now I am in the midst of adding a better user account system.  I have procrastinated finishing it up for a couple of months now; not as much spare time as I would like.  I have been working on building up my clientel, which has eaten up somme of my time, as well as school and the night job.
